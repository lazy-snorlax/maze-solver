# Maze Solver

Generate a maze and use an A* search algorithm to solve it. Depth-First search is also implemented, but will need to be activated manually in _main.py_.

## How to use
Clone this repo and make sure you have Python 3 installed. Run the following:
```
python3 main.py
```

If everything works, this should display a window and you can watch a maze being generated and then solved.
